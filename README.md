### iTerm2 Profiles
---

Terminal is a crucial part of a developer's daily routine. A good looking and powerful terminal shell can help you save significant amount of time and efforts, so you can focus on the thing which matters the most: *Coding*!

I am a big fan of iTerm2 and zsh which provide a whole lot of useful features as compared to the traditional terminal. You can download iTerm2 from [here](https://iterm2.com/downloads.html) and oh-my-zsh, which is a framework for zsh, from [here](https://ohmyz.sh/#install).

Once, both of the above mentioned tools have been installed on the system, open the Preferences from iTerm2 menu or by simply using the keyboard shortcut `âŒ˜,`. Then go to the **Profiles** tab, where you can create your own profile or import a theme profile.

You can find a wide range of themes created for oh-my-zsh [here](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Themes).

Here are some of the profiles which I have created over time to transform the UI of my terminal shell.

- [Sombre Forest](Sombre-Forest.json)

- [Frosty](Frosty.json)
