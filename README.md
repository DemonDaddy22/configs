## Config Files
---

This repository contains a bunch of configuration files used by me to Bootstrap some of my projects and tools to increase my productivity. Feel free to use any of these files to enhance your productivity too!

### iTerm2 Profiles
---

Terminal is a crucial part of a developer's daily routine. A good looking and powerful terminal shell can help you save significant amount of time and efforts, so you can focus on the thing which matters the most: *Coding*!

I am a big fan of iTerm2 and zsh which provide a whole lot of useful features as compared to the traditional terminal. You can download iTerm2 from [here](https://iterm2.com/downloads.html) and oh-my-zsh, which is a framework for zsh, from [here](https://ohmyz.sh/#install).

Once, both of the above mentioned tools have been installed on the system, open the Preferences from iTerm2 menu or by simply using the keyboard shortcut `âŒ˜,`. Then go to the **Profiles** tab, where you can create your own profile or import a theme profile.

You can find a wide range of themes created for oh-my-zsh [here](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Themes).

Here are some of the profiles which I have created over time to transform the UI of my terminal shell.
